This Repository Has only codes and open licenced eye tracking scripts, used by me. Credits to Intel. Does not contain the CNN Model File. All Cascade files should be kept in a single folder while executing as the model code will look for a "haar cascade files" folder to search for eye tracking and positioning scripts.
